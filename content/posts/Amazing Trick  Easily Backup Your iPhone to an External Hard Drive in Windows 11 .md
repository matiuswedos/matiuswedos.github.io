An external hard drive is a storage device that connects to your computer through a USB port. It’s different from an internal hard drive, which is located inside your computer and is not removable. An external hard drive is more convenient because it’s portable and can be used to store large amounts of data.

## Benefits of Backing up an iPhone to an External Hard Drive

Backing up your iPhone to an external hard drive has several advantages. First, it’s a secure way to store your data. An external hard drive is not connected to the internet, so your data is less vulnerable to hackers or viruses. Second, it’s convenient.
