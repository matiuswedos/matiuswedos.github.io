## Introduction

Have you ever broken your phone's screen and wondered if there was a way to access the device's data without having to replace the screen? The good news is that you can do this by enabling USB debugging on your Android device with a broken screen. In this blog post, we'll discuss what USB debugging is, the benefits of enabling USB debugging, and how to enable USB debugging on an Android device with a broken screen. 

## Definition of USB Debugging

USB debugging is a feature of the Android operating system that allows developers to access the device's internal data and settings. It can be used to install and debug apps, transfer files, and even control the device remotely. 

## Benefits of Enabling USB Debugging

Enabling USB debugging on your Android device can have several benefits. First, it allows you to access the device's internal data and settings, which can be useful for troubleshooting and debugging apps. Second, it can be used to transfer files between your computer and the device. Finally, it can be used to control the device remotely, which can be helpful if you need to access the device without being able to physically touch it. 

## How to Enable USB Debugging on an Android Device With a Broken Screen

There are several ways to enable USB debugging on an Android device with a broken screen. The following are some of the most common methods: 

### Using ADB Commands

ADB (Android Debug Bridge) is a command line tool that allows you to access the device's internal data and settings. To enable USB debugging using ADB commands, you will need to install the Android SDK Platform-Tools on your computer. Once the tools are installed, you will need to connect your device to your computer via USB and run the following command: 

```
adb devices
```

This will list the connected devices and you can then use the following command to enable USB debugging: 

```
adb shell settings put global adb_enabled 1
```

### Using Android SDK Platform-Tools

If you don't want to use ADB commands, you can also use the Android SDK Platform-Tools to enable USB debugging on your device. To do this, you will need to install the platform-tools on your computer and connect your device via USB. Once connected, you can open the platform-tools folder and run the following command: 

```
./adb devices
```

This will list the connected devices and you can then use the following command to enable USB debugging: 

```
./adb shell settings put global adb_enabled 1
```

### Using Third-Party Software

Finally, you can also use third-party software to enable USB debugging on your device. Most of these software programs are designed to work with broken or damaged screens, so you don't have to worry about connecting the device to your computer. All you have to do is download the software and follow the instructions to enable USB debugging. 

## Conclusion

Enabling USB debugging on an Android device with a broken screen can be a great way to access the device's internal data and settings without having to replace the screen. There are several ways to do this, including using ADB commands, the Android SDK Platform-Tools, or third-party software. Whichever method you choose, enabling USB debugging can be a great way to access the device's data without having to replace the screen.
