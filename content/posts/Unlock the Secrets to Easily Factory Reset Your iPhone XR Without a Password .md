A factory reset (also known as a “hard reset”) is a process that restores your device to its original, out-of-the-box settings.

### Erase All Content and Settings
The final step is to erase all content and settings from your iPhone XR. To do this, open the Settings app, tap on “General”, then tap on “Reset” and select “Erase All Content and Settings”. This will reset your device to its factory settings. 

## Conclusion
In conclusion, a factory reset can be a great way to restore your iPhone XR to its original settings, erase all of your data, and remove any unwanted apps or software.
