In this blog post, we’ll discuss the benefits of stopping sleep mode on your iPhone 8 and provide step-by-step instructions on how to do it. 

## Overview of iPhone 8 Sleep Mode

When your iPhone 8 goes into sleep mode, it will turn off the display and put itself into a low-power state. This helps conserve battery life, but it can also be annoying if you’re in the middle of something and your phone shuts off without warning. 

## Benefits of Stopping Sleep Mode

Stopping sleep mode on your iPhone 8 has several benefits. First, it will help conserve battery life. This is because your iPhone 8 won’t be using as much power when it’s not in sleep mode. Additionally, it will help keep your phone from shutting off unexpectedly, which can be especially helpful if you’re in the middle of something important.
