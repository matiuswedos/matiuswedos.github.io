## Definition of Facebook Messenger

Facebook Messenger is an instant messaging platform developed by Facebook. It allows users to send and receive messages, photos, videos, audio, and other files. It also allows users to make voice and video calls.

## Overview of the Problem

## How to Remove Facebook Messenger Bubbles

Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to get rid of those pesky bubbles.

### Identify the Source of the Bubble

The first step is to identify the source of the bubble. Is it coming from the Facebook app itself, or is it coming from a third-party app? If it's coming from a third-party app, you'll need to uninstall it.

### Disable Notifications

If the bubble is coming from the Facebook app itself, you can disable notifications. To do this, go to the Facebook app, tap the menu button, and select "Settings." From there, you can turn off notifications for specific people or groups.

### Uninstall the App

If disabling notifications doesn't work, you can always uninstall the app. This will completely remove the app from your device, and the bubbles will no longer appear.
