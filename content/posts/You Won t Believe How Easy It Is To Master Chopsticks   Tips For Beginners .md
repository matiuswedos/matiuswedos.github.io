Hold the chopsticks in the same way you would hold a pencil. Place the top chopstick between your thumb and index finger and the bottom chopstick between your middle finger and ring finger. Make sure the top chopstick is slightly higher than the bottom one.

### Holding the Chopsticks
Gently squeeze the chopsticks together and move the top chopstick up and down in a sawing motion. This will allow you to pick up food with the chopsticks.

### Practice and Patience
Like any skill, mastering chopsticks takes practice and patience. Don't be discouraged if it takes you a few tries to get the hang of it.
