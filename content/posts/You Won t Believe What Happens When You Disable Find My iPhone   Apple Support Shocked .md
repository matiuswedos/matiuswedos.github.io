## Overview of Find My iPhone

Find My iPhone is a feature of Apple's iCloud service that allows you to track the location of your device, remotely lock it, or even wipe its data if it's lost or stolen. It's available on all iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches with iOS 5 or later.

## Benefits of Find My iPhone
